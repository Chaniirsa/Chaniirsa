. My real name is Thapelo Kholu A.K.A Chanii Rsa, (Male) by my artistry stage name. I'm from Ficksburg, a Town called Meqheleng, this is whereby I did my pre school, Primary school (Meqheleng Primary school) and High school (Marallaneng Senior Secondary School) and later on I Moved to Bloemfontein to further my studies at tertiary level to obtain my Degree in Bachelor of Business Administration.

I startes doing music in 2016 when I was 15 and then endured further on this journey to working with Top artists like Kopper Waleh, DeejayZacca, Ntate Stunna and Cheez Beezy et.c this has put so much experience into my life especially with the path I took.

Since from a Young age I haven't picked a job and said I'm Going to work but mostly because it has not been time for me to say now I'm looking for a job but I took a path whereby I felt I could definitely ensure that I put my musical career on a top level. So no I don't have a job experience. 

With me, I only love soccer and chess but mostly chess, this is because I grew up with the love for it especially from primary school then high school I played it even when we were visiting other schools I would played for my school (Marallaneng Senior Secondary School) . 

Within my career of music I've had so much experiences and life turning moments whereby I could finally see that this is a break through and it endeavors my life to say that I' am indeed the person that I thought I was. Today I am a singer and songwriter, a producer, a director,  and "Ska Ntatela clothing" brand owner. Performing at different stages like at Rosebank College event, Rosendal, Mapenyadira Hall in Ficksburg, Itekeng Hall and many more. This truly upturned my whole musical scene with as much experience as possible. 

Chanii Rsa is a very Humble person, he doesn't speak alot only when necessary, he's a God Fearing person and he's into ZCC church. He loved and re-creates the whole creativity of his work. 

In all my Career I have released 1 E.P (On My Way E. P) and 5 singles accompanied By " I will be better" certified hit song by my fans released in 2023 and singles like No More pain ft Mow Tee and Chilli Bee, Nomakanjani ft Kay-Liegh those are the songs that put me on and overturned my career a whole new experience.
